        <h2 class="my-3">Armies of the Adepta Sororitas</h2>
        <p>The famed Orders Militant or Sisters of Battle of the Adepta Sororitas pursue the ways of war to spread the Emperor's light.
        The Orders Militant are often tasked by the Ecclesiarchy with defending its Shrine and Cardinal Worlds or retaking such planets from Heretics, xenos or the blasphemous forces of Chaos.
        There are literally dozens of different Orders Militant, with their convents scattered across the galaxy.<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Orders Majoris</h3>
        <p class="text-center">There are six Orders Militant Majoris in the Adepta Sororitas that are widely recognised across the Imperium.<p>

        <h3 class="my-3" id="BloodyRose">Order of the Bloody Rose</h3>
          <p>The Order of the Bloody Rose is one of the major Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas, or the Sisters of Battle, founded in honour of Saint Mina by the Ecclesiarch Deacis VI in the middle of the 38th Millennium. They are based on the Cardinal World of Ophelia VII within the Convent Sanctorum.<br>
          <br>
          The order also operates a full preceptory of battle-sisters at the Shrine of the Seventeen Martyrs near the Hive World of Malfi in response to brewing religious conflicts in the Drusus Marches, a sub-sector of the Calixis Sector located in the Segmentum Obscurus.<br>
          <br>
          Though the Order of the Bloody Rose has committed a significant contingent of its sisters to war zones along the Great Rift since the dawn of the Era Indomitus, the majority of its forces are battling against incursions coming from the galactic south.<br>
          <br>
          They have met the tendrils of Hive Fleet Leviathan and Hive Fleet Hydra on multiple fronts, where they have butchered the ravenous creatures and the Genestealer Cults that worship them.<br>
          <br>
          They have also fought a series of harrowing battles against the Thousand Sons Traitor Legion's Cult of Duplicity, combating the sorcerous machinations of the Tzeentch-worshippers with bolt, blade and faith.</p><br>
          <br>
        <h3 class="my-3" id="MartyredLady">Order of the Martyred Lady</h3>
          <p>The Order of Our Martyred Lady is one of the major Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas, or the Sisters of Battle, founded in honour of Saint Katherine by the Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII (the long-lived successor of the great reformer, Sebastian Thor)
          in the 36th Millennium when the location of the Adepta Sororitas' primary convent was split between Terra and Ophelia VII, creating, among others, the Order of Our Martyred Lady.<br>
          <br>
          Of all the Orders Militant, there are none more numerous or more widely spread than the Order of Our Martyred Lady. Their name is known by the ruling elites and unwashed masses alike on countless worlds across the galaxy,
          and when spoken evokes hope in the righteous and fear amongst the faithless.<br>
          <br>
          The order is renowned for its unrelenting pursuit of those who defy the Emperor by doing harm to His Imperium and its citizens. Xenos, marauders, Chaos armies and heretical cults are met with burning fury by the Sisters of Our Martyred Lady,
          who gather wherever the enemy is found to scour them from existence.<br>
          <br>
          The Order of Our Martyred Lady holds fortified sanctuaries on a great many Imperial worlds, many of which date back to Saint Katherine's Wars of Faith. Some of these sanctuaries operate in relative isolation,
          existing far beyond the established boundaries of the order's parish, but the majority are located in the Segmentum Obscurus.<br>
          <br>
          The broad distribution of the order's preceptories has seen the sisters of the Order of Our Martyred Lady engage in many of the Imperium's most gruelling war zones. On Armageddon,
          the sisters amassed to defend the Sanctorum of Saint Katherine against the Ork hordes of Ghazghkull Thraka.<br>
          <br>
          Though fully half of their number were martyred, they inflicted such casualties on their enemies that vital greenskin forces were drawn away from other battlefronts, the sheer grit of the sisters enticing Orks from far and wide to join the siege.<br>
          <br>
          The order also fought on Cadia during the 13th Black Crusade of Abaddon the Despoiler. Though the planet eventually fell, the faith held by those who battled there led to a great miracle,
          with Saint Celestine appearing from the Warp to bolster the defenders in their darkest hour.<br>
          <br>
          Although the Great Rift now divides many of the order's sanctuaries, the sisters of Our Martyred Lady have not relented in their quest to avenge the Imperium's fallen heroes.
          They stand dauntless against the Chaos forces that pour from newly opened Warp Storms, and they march out to annihilate any foe that would prey upon Humanity's beleaguered defenders.<br>
          <br>
          The fire of their spirit is a beacon of hope, a sign that even in this time of abounding horror, the Emperor has not abandoned His faithful servants.</p><br>
          <br>
        <h3 id="ValorousHeart">Order of the Valorous Heart</h3>
          <p>The Order of the Valorous Heart was founded in honour of Saint Lucia by the Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII,
            the long-lived successor of the great reformer, Sebastian Thor, in the 36th Millennium.<br>
            <br>
            At the time of the order's founding, the Convent Sanctorum was split between the convents on Ophelia VII and Terra, which created the Orders Militant of the Ebon Chalice, Valorous Heart, Fiery Heart and the Argent Shroud.<br>
            <br>
            Sisters of the Order of the Valorous Heart are driven by the belief that they still must atone for the sisterhood's acts as an unwitting accomplice to the
            Renegade High Lord of Terra Goge Vandire during the Age of Apostasy's Reign of Blood in the 36th Millennium.<br>
            <br>
            Like their patron Saint Lucia, the order is highly penitent, always striving for atonement for even the slightest perceived sin. A disproportionate number of
            sisters in this order exile themselves to the Sisters Repentia compared to the other major Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas.<br>
            <br>
            Because they are constantly reminded of their part in the Reign of Blood, sisters of the Valorous Heart can be particularly suspicious of those who would call themselves prophets of the Emperor.<br>
            <br>
            The bulk of the Order of the Valorous Heart's sanctuaries lie deep in the Ultima Segmentum, with the vast majority having been established during hard-fought wars against xenos and Traitor forces.
            Sanctified fortresses stand amidst Death World swamps, jagged mountain ranges and barren wastelands that were scoured of life millennia ago.
            Relief sculptures and stained armaglass panes within these sanctuaries depict Sororitas obliterating hordes of Orks, driving Necrons back beneath the sands and roasting foul Heretics in cleansing flames.<br>
            <br>
            Many of these sanctuary planets were plunged into darkness when the Great Rift tore open at the start of the Era Indomitus,
            and were invaded by daemons or subjected to mass Drukhari raids. Yet the order has not wavered in its faith.<br>
            <br>
            Though many of its preceptories are cut off from the light of the Emperor, they believe He still sees their struggles.
            They refer to this time of great trial as the "Hour of Abacination," for the Imperium Nihilus has been blinded, just as Lucia was. But like their Matriarch,
            the Order of the Valorous Heart have steeled themselves to endure whatever torments are thrust upon them.</p><br>
