        <p>The famed Orders Militant or Sisters of Battle of the Adepta Sororitas pursue the ways of war to spread the Emperor's light.
        The Orders Militant are often tasked by the Ecclesiarchy with defending its Shrine and Cardinal Worlds or retaking such planets from Heretics, xenos or the blasphemous forces of Chaos.
        There are literally dozens of different Orders Militant, with their convents scattered across the galaxy.<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Orders Majoris</h3>
        <p class="text-center">There are six Orders Militant Majoris in the Adepta Sororitas that are widely recognised across the Imperium.<p>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A sister of the Bloody Rose</figcaption>
        </figure>
          <p>The Order of the Bloody was founded in honour of Saint Mina by the Ecclesiarch Deacis VI in the middle of the 38th Millennium. They are based on the Cardinal World of Ophelia VII within the Convent Sanctorum.<br>
          <br>
          The order also operates a full preceptory of battle-sisters at the Shrine of the Seventeen Martyrs near the Hive World of Malfi in response to brewing religious conflicts in the Drusus Marches, a sub-sector of the Calixis Sector located in the Segmentum Obscurus.<br>
          <br>
          Though the Order of the Bloody Rose has committed a significant contingent of its sisters to war zones along the Great Rift since the dawn of the Era Indomitus, the majority of its forces are battling against incursions coming from the galactic south.<br>
          <br>
          They have met the tendrils of Hive Fleet Leviathan and Hive Fleet Hydra on multiple fronts, where they have butchered the ravenous creatures and the Genestealer Cults that worship them.<br>
          <br>
          They have also fought a series of harrowing battles against the Thousand Sons Traitor Legion's Cult of Duplicity, combating the sorcerous machinations of the Tzeentch-worshippers with bolt, blade and faith.</p><br>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A sister of the Martyred Lady</figcaption>
        </figure>
          <p>The Order of Our Martyred Lady was founded in honour of Saint Katherine by the Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII (the long-lived successor of the great reformer, Sebastian Thor)
          in the 36th Millennium when the location of the Adepta Sororitas' primary convent was split between Terra and Ophelia VII, creating, among others, the Order of Our Martyred Lady.<br>
          <br>
          Of all the Orders Militant, there are none more numerous or more widely spread than the Order of Our Martyred Lady. Their name is known by the ruling elites and unwashed masses alike on countless worlds across the galaxy,
          and when spoken evokes hope in the righteous and fear amongst the faithless.<br>
          <br>
          The order is renowned for its unrelenting pursuit of those who defy the Emperor by doing harm to His Imperium and its citizens. Xenos, marauders, Chaos armies and heretical cults are met with burning fury by the Sisters of Our Martyred Lady,
          who gather wherever the enemy is found to scour them from existence.<br>
          <br>
          The Order of Our Martyred Lady holds fortified sanctuaries on a great many Imperial worlds, many of which date back to Saint Katherine's Wars of Faith. Some of these sanctuaries operate in relative isolation,
          existing far beyond the established boundaries of the order's parish, but the majority are located in the Segmentum Obscurus.<br>
          <br>
          The broad distribution of the order's preceptories has seen the sisters of the Order of Our Martyred Lady engage in many of the Imperium's most gruelling war zones. On Armageddon,
          the sisters amassed to defend the Sanctorum of Saint Katherine against the Ork hordes of Ghazghkull Thraka.<br>
          <br>
          Though fully half of their number were martyred, they inflicted such casualties on their enemies that vital greenskin forces were drawn away from other battlefronts, the sheer grit of the sisters enticing Orks from far and wide to join the siege.<br>
          <br>
          The order also fought on Cadia during the 13th Black Crusade of Abaddon the Despoiler. Though the planet eventually fell, the faith held by those who battled there led to a great miracle,
          with Saint Celestine appearing from the Warp to bolster the defenders in their darkest hour.<br>
          <br>
          Although the Great Rift now divides many of the order's sanctuaries, the sisters of Our Martyred Lady have not relented in their quest to avenge the Imperium's fallen heroes.
          They stand dauntless against the Chaos forces that pour from newly opened Warp Storms, and they march out to annihilate any foe that would prey upon Humanity's beleaguered defenders.<br>
          <br>
          The fire of their spirit is a beacon of hope, a sign that even in this time of abounding horror, the Emperor has not abandoned His faithful servants.</p><br>

        <h3 id="ValorousHeart">Order of the Valorous Heart</h3>
        <figure class="figure float-end">
          <img class="figure-img img-fluid imgBase" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91533120/143939579-c629ce85-7afb-465d-b45b-9e58291da851.jpg">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A sister of the Valorous Heart</figcaption>
        </figure>
          <p>The Order of the Valorous Heart was founded in honour of Saint Lucia by the Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII,
            the long-lived successor of the great reformer, Sebastian Thor, in the 36th Millennium.<br>
            <br>
            At the time of the order's founding, the Convent Sanctorum was split between the convents on Ophelia VII and Terra, which created the Orders Militant of the Ebon Chalice, Valorous Heart, Fiery Heart and the Argent Shroud.<br>
            <br>
            Sisters of the Order of the Valorous Heart are driven by the belief that they still must atone for the sisterhood's acts as an unwitting accomplice to the
            Renegade High Lord of Terra Goge Vandire during the Age of Apostasy's Reign of Blood in the 36th Millennium.<br>
            <br>
            Like their patron Saint Lucia, the order is highly penitent, always striving for atonement for even the slightest perceived sin. A disproportionate number of
            sisters in this order exile themselves to the Sisters Repentia compared to the other major Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas.<br>
            <br>
            Because they are constantly reminded of their part in the Reign of Blood, sisters of the Valorous Heart can be particularly suspicious of those who would call themselves prophets of the Emperor.<br>
            <br>
            The bulk of the Order of the Valorous Heart's sanctuaries lie deep in the Ultima Segmentum, with the vast majority having been established during hard-fought wars against xenos and Traitor forces.
            Sanctified fortresses stand amidst Death World swamps, jagged mountain ranges and barren wastelands that were scoured of life millennia ago.
            Relief sculptures and stained armaglass panes within these sanctuaries depict Sororitas obliterating hordes of Orks, driving Necrons back beneath the sands and roasting foul Heretics in cleansing flames.<br>
            <br>
            Many of these sanctuary planets were plunged into darkness when the Great Rift tore open at the start of the Era Indomitus,
            and were invaded by daemons or subjected to mass Drukhari raids. Yet the order has not wavered in its faith.<br>
            <br>
            Though many of its preceptories are cut off from the light of the Emperor, they believe He still sees their struggles.
            They refer to this time of great trial as the "Hour of Abacination," for the Imperium Nihilus has been blinded, just as Lucia was. But like their Matriarch,
            the Order of the Valorous Heart have steeled themselves to endure whatever torments are thrust upon them.</p><br>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A sister of the Sacred Rose</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p>The Order of the Sacred Rose was founded in honour of Saint Arabella by the Ecclesiarch Deacis VI in the middle of the 38th
              Millennium at the same time as the Order of the Bloody Rose was founded. The order is based on Terra in the Convent Prioris.<br>
              <br>
              n the wake of the mad High Lord Goge Vandire's downfall in the 36th Millennium, which ended his tyrannical Reign of Blood, Sebastian Thor was declared Ecclesiarch, and instituted sweeping reforms to the Ecclesiarchy.
              The High Lords of Terra were fearful of a repetition of the Reign of Blood. And so the "Decree Passive" was passed, forbidding the Ecclesiarchy from maintaining "men under arms."<br>
              <br>
              Alicia Dominica, leader of the Daughters of the Emperor, at Thor's order, formally founded the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas, which adhered to the letter if not the spirit of the decree in that all its warriors were female.<br>
              <br>
              Following Thor's Reformation of the Ecclesiarchy, the newly founded Adepta Sororitas were split between the Convent Prioris on Holy Terra and the Convent Sanctorum on Ophelia VII.<br>
              <br>
              Both of these convents are massive fortresses housing tens of thousands of sisters. Those sisters still residing at San Leor were transported to the new convents, and the foundations of the non-militant orders were laid.<br>
              <br>
              In time, the Orders Militant grew into larger and more powerful organisations and Sebastian Thor's successor, the Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII, decreed that the two convents each be divided into two Orders Militant.<br>
              <br>
              Though Arabella was only canonised posthumously, she performed countless miracles during her lifetime. She travelled the Imperium serving as a commander and beacon of faith for many solar decades. <br>
              The circumstances surrounding her martyrdom are not recorded in any Ecclesiarchal text, but in the 38th Millennium the Order of the Sacred Rose was founded in her name.
              <br>
              Ecclesiarch Deacis VI formed the order from the sisters of the Convent Prioris, and from the outset the Sacred Rose proved themselves worthy of their Matriarch.
              Through their Wars of Faith they brought the light of the Emperor to regions long thought lost to the darkness -- Imperial planets were freed from the yoke of heretical tyrants,
              cabals of xenos mystics were hunted down and butchered, and sanctuaries were established to serve as outposts of divinity in the most remote corners of the Imperium.<br>
              <br>
              The Sacred Rose forged a sizeable parish in the Ultima Segmentum, but like Arabella they brought their faith to bear across the galaxy.<br>
              <br>
              Like the Order of the Bloody Rose, the Order of the Sacred Rose was not established during the existence of its patron saint -- Arabella. In her lifetime,
              Arabella earned the honorific of "Liberator" and many battle-sisters, especially Retributors, are known to pray to her spirit for liberation from doubt and rash action when a cool, logical head is required.<br>
              <br>
              Of all Dominica's bodyguards, Arabella was known as a particularly disciplined, even-tempered sister. However, behind her serenity lay the determination of a resolute warrior,
              and her symbol was thus a white rose, held aloft in a mailed gauntlet.<br>
              <br>
              The white-armoured Sisters of the Sacred Rose embody these same virtues, facing down alien hordes and Warp-spawned monsters with bolters calmly levelled where lesser warriors would panic and falter.</p> <br>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A sister of the Ebon Chalice</figcaption>
          </figure>
            <p> The Order of the Ebon Chalice was founded in honour of Saint Alicia Dominica by the Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII in the 36th Millennium when the Convent Sanctorum was split between the convents on Ophelia VII and Terra,
              founding the Orders of the Ebon Chalice, the Valorous Heart, the Fiery Heart and the Argent Shroud.<br>
              <br>
              Like all of Humanity, the Order of the Ebon Chalice has been faced with untold horrors since the Great Rift opened at the start of the Era Indomitus. Alongside their allies of old --
              the Adeptus Custodes, Space Marines and Adeptus Mechanicus -- the spiritual descendants of Dominica fight to keep the unleashed forces of Chaos from overwhelming the Segmentum Solar.<br>
              <br>
              The sisters have eradicated several warbands of Chaos Space Marines, most notably the Blades of the Despoiler -- a Khornate host of the Black Legion whose path of slaughter was headed directly for Terra. Yet the Ebon Chalice has also taken heavy losses.<br>
              <br>
              Though the Schola Progenium proffers a constant stream of new recruits, only the most promising are accepted into the order, and of those only a small percentage prove themselves in the gruelling initiation rites to become battle-sisters.<br>
              <br>
              This has left the sisters of the Ebon Chalice straining against the sheer weight of the heretical incursions -- but they are far from broken.
              Each is an expert in the ancient forms of battle established by the Daughters of the Emperor, a warrior who has mastered both their weaponry and their faith.<br>
              <br>
              Those who prove themselves worthy enough to rise to the rank of Celestian or Zephyrim are amongst the most skilled veterans in the entire Adepta Sororitas.
              The most honoured of these sisters are even entrusted with a portion of the hallowed truth learnt by their Matriarch in the chamber of the Golden Throne.</p><br>

          <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A sister of the Argent Shroud</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p>The Order of the Argent Shroud was founded in honour of Saint Silvana by the Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII (the long-lived successor of the great reformer, Sebastian Thor) in the 36th Millennium.<br>
              <br>
              It was at that time that the Convent Sanctorum was split between the convents on Ophelia VII and Terra, founding the Orders Militant of the Ebon Chalice, Valorous Heart, Fiery Heart and the Argent Shroud.<br>
              <br>
              The majority of the Argent Shroud's sanctuaries lie in the region of space that abuts the jagged mass of Warp Storms known as the Great Rift. During the Noctis Aeterna,
              when Chaos energies were blasted across the galaxy and the light of the holy Astronomican was temporarily extinguished, many of these sanctuary worlds were thought lost.<br>
              <br>
              Screaming maelstroms enveloped entire sub-parishes, while countless other worlds under the order's watch were bathed in the warping glow of the Cicatrix Maledictum.
              As galactic maps were compiled and the true scale of the horror became apparent, it was estimated that as many as eighty percent of the Argent Shroud's sisters might have been swallowed by the yawning maw.<br>
              <br>
              But in the harrowing years of the Era Indomitus since, the order has continued to fight against the marauding forces of Chaos without showing any signs of diminishment.
              The Sororitas appear without warning in raging war zones along the breadth of the Great Rift, striking with crippling speed at their unprepared enemies.<br>
              <br>
              Multiple preceptories that were thought lost have since been seen in battle, and though they say nothing of the fates of their sanctuary worlds, they fight with unmatched hatred against the servants of the Dark Gods.<br>
