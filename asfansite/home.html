          <p>Warhammer 40,000 is a miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop, which is set in the distant future, where a stagnant human civilisation is beset by hostile aliens and supernatural creatures.
            The models in the game are a mixture of humans, aliens, and supernatural monsters, wielding futuristic weaponry and supernatural powers.
            The fictional setting of the game has been developed through a large body of novels, published by Black Library (Games Workshop's publishing division).<br>
            <br>
            Most Warhammer 40,000 fiction is set around the turn of the 42nd millennium (about 39,000 years in the future). Although Warhammer 40,000 is mostly a science-fiction setting,
            it adapts a number of tropes from fantasy fiction, such as magic, supernatural beings, daemonic possession, and races such as Orks and Elves; "psykers" fill the role of wizards in the setting.
            The setting of this game inherits many fantasy tropes from Warhammer Fantasy (a similar wargame from Games Workshop), but these two settings are not connected despite the shared name.<br>
            <br>
            The setting of Warhammer 40,000 is violent and pessimistic. It depicts a future where human scientific and social progress have ceased,
            and human civilisation is close to collapse due to war with hostile alien races and occult forces.
            It is a setting where the supernatural exists, is powerful, and is usually untrustworthy if not outright malevolent.
            There are no benevolent gods or spirits in the cosmos, only daemons and evil gods, and the cults dedicated to them are growing.<br>
            <br>
            In the long run, the Imperium of Man cannot hope to defeat its enemies, so the heroes of the Imperium are not fighting for a brighter future but "raging against the dying of the light".
            The tone of the setting has led to a subgenre of science fiction called "grimdark", which is particularly amoral, dystopian or violent.<br>
            <br>
            One of the factions of 'Warhammer 40k' is Adepta Sororitas, or Sisters of Battle, who are fighting for the Imperium of Man. This fansite is dedicated to Adepta Sororitas, and you can learn more of their history and lore on its pages.
